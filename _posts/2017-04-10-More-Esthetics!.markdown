I replaced the composite restoration on #9 for a fellow classmate to correct color and incisal edge length. Just in time for his upcoming wedding photos!
<br>
<br/>
#9 was initially restored due to trauma and has darkened intrinsically.

A better matched restoration with multiple layers of esthetic composite was the treatment of choice. The patient RCT and internal bleaching to whiten the tooth one of the only options to lighten the a better matching restoration with slightly longer incisal edge was possibly the best and most conservative option for the patient at this point.
