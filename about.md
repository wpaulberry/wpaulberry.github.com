 <strong>my background...</strong>
 <br>
 <br/>
 <p>When I was young I stumbled upon my older brother's abandoned plastic scale model car. The attention to tiny details fascinated me. As a visual learner, I've been drawn to anything requiring precision and dexterity.</p>
 <p>Growing up in small-town Colorado, my upbringing showed me the importance of the setting and community of where I live. I studied both Spanish and Business Administration at Carroll College in Helena before realizing that Dentistry offered a unique blend of the things most valuable to me:</p>
 <p><strong>PROBLEM SOLVING, CREATIVITY, COMMUNITY.</strong></p>
