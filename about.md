**my background...**
When I was young I stumbled upon my older brother's abandoned plastic scale model car. The attention to tiny details fascinated me. As a visual learner, I've been drawn to anything requiring precision and dexterity.
Growing up in small-town Colorado, my upbringing showed me the importance of the setting and community of where I live. I studied both Spanish and Business Administration at Carroll College in Helena before realizing that Dentistry offered a unique blend of the things most valuable to me: **PEOPLE, CREATIVITY, AUTONOMY.**
